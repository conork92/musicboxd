# musicboxd

Ideally this becomes a letterboxd like app, currently it's just trying to get the best album from every country in the world


Imagine at some point I will add some of the results / functionality to my website:
https://www.ckmusic.online/
or create a new one


Ideas:

- Type a sentence and it matches to some music

- add airflow

- Add Kafka

- Use Kubernetes

- Use: https://www.netlify.com/ ?


Instructions for using the Repo:

- Install git hook
pip install pre-commit

pre-commit install --hook-type pr

psql -h localhost -U postgres
